Cloud Foundations
I. What is Cloud Computing? (Answered by [___])
    A. [Cloud Vikings] Cloud computing enables convenient, remote, on-demand access, to a shared pool of computer resources and services.
    B. [AWS] Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technoloagy services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    C. [NIST] Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. 
        1. (Essential Characteristics) On-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.
            a. On-demand self-service - the ability to create IT resources, such as compute, storage, and databases yourself, without the need to interact with other humans to do the work
            b. Broad network access - the cloud resources are available to us over a network and are accessible through standard protocols
            c. Resource pooling - [the cloud resources are available to us over a network and are accessible through standard protocols]
            d. Rapid elasticity - the ability to quickly scale your cloud resources based on changing demands
            e. Measured service - the cloud provider has automated systems to provide transparent billing details about the cloud resources you are consuming. Allowing you, as the customer, to have monitoring and reporting capabilities of these cloud resources.
        2. (Service Models) Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
            a. IaaS - on-premise is whole control, set up VMs to run apps and other software, more control
            b. PaaS - everything set up for you, just run the application, less control
            c. SaaS - application is run for you, just decide how to use and remote access it, no control
        3. (Deployment Models) Private cloud, Community cloud, Public cloud, and Hybrid cloud.
            a. Private cloud - exclusive use by a single organization
                i. Benefits: Control, Cost, Hardware Choice, Software Licenses (Hardware based/locked), Security
            b. Community cloud - exclusive use by a specific community of consumers
            c. Public cloud - open use by the general public
                i. Benefits: Scalability, Cost savings, Speed, Global capability
                ii. Capital Expenses (CapEx) -> Operational expenses (OpEx) beneficial for smaller companies
                iii. Other Benefits: Pay-as-you-Go, Agility, On-Demand, Infinite Scale, Experimentation, Low-cost experiments, Security
            d. Hybrid cloud - composed of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public)
                i. Multi-cloud - easier transportability but less discounts if spread over multiple cloud infrastructures
                ii. Benefits: Use existing infrastructure, Cost savings, security requirements

        3. Reserved Instances (1 or 3 year plan) -  up front stated instance type, size, OS, and tenancy (Standard) or if you need to run in different Availiability Zones or different instance types (Convertible)
        4. Spot Instances - flexible start and end times, and can withstand interruptions [90% off On-Demand]
        5. Dedicated Hosts - most expensive physical servers with Amazon EC2 capacity that is fully dedicated to your use
    B. For example, if your use case can withstand interruptions, you can save with Spot Instances. You can also save by committing early and locking in a minimum level of use with Reserved Instances.
IV. Scaling Amazon EC2
    A. Scalability and Elasticity
        1. Scalability involves beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in.
    B. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
        1. Dynamic scaling - responds to changing demand
        2. Predictive scaling - automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand

        2. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic - a channel for messages to be delivered, a publish/subscribe service
            a. Send one message to SNS
            b. SNS sends notifications to all end users or endpoints
            c. Customers/Clients can opt for certain topics to be "subscribed" to and others to be omitted from
    C. Monolithic applications and Microservices
        1. Tighly coupled components inside the monolithic application
        2. Components communicate with each other to transmit data, fulfill requests and keep the application running
        3. In a monolithic application, when one component fails to communicate, the rest fail too.
        4. In a microservice approach, components are loosely coupled which prevents the entire application from failing.
